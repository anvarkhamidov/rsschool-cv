            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Now I am Junior Back-end Developer, mostly work with Python for different kind of tasks (web, data analysis, telegram bots). I got a job as an intern in IT company which mostly directed in programming with Python, so now I know what I will do. I want to obtain perfect knowledge of JavaScript as I want to connect it to my python applications (SPA, Django+React/VueJS/Angular) not only for this kind of projects, but there is a fact that currently JavaScript is one of the best languages that are used virtually everywhere. I acknowledge this course does not guarantee that I will become skilled JS programmer, or even mentor, if I will not try to do my best and work on my own also.</p>

            <h3>English</h3>
            <p>I have been learning English since I am schoolboy until now. However, as I had some break time on summer, I forgot most important parts of English which led on decrease in my speaking and grammar. Despite this, I can fully understand documentations, and everything written in English. I took IELTS also, which means I have known English quite well. But anyway, sorry beforehand for grammar, lexical mistakes or what mistakes I have in this resume.</p>
