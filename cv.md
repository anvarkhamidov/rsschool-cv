Summary
-------
Now I am Junior Back-end Developer, mostly work with *[Python](https://python.org)* for different kind of tasks (_web, data analysis, telegram bots_). I got a job as an intern in IT company which mostly directed in programming with *[Python](https://python.org)*, so now I know what I will do. I want to obtain perfect knowledge of *[JavaScript](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)* as I want to connect it to my python applications (_SPA, Django+React/VueJS/Angular_) not only for this kind of projects, but there is a fact that currently *[JavaScript](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)* is one of the best languages that are used virtually everywhere. I acknowledge this course does not guarantee that I will become skilled JS programmer, or even mentor, if I will not try to do my best and work on my own also.

Skills
------
I know syntax of *[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift)*, *[Java](https://www.java.com/)* and basic knowledge in *[JavaScript](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)*, HTML&CSS, C++ included, of course. 
I want to learn each of them, but unfortunately, I do not have enough time for this. Besides, I have some experience on working with *Git Version Control* to have my projects always updated on my repository. Mostly, I work with *[Django]()* framework, however *[Flask]()* is not new for me too.

Code examples
-------------
Currently I have only product which is in production: [Telegram Online Shop Bot](https://t.me/Anori_bot) (I cannot provide code for this, as it is in production and I have an agreement with contractor), [Simple Django CRUD System](https://gitlab.com/anvarkhamidov/django-book-library) (has many bugs :D), and now I am working on Back-end development using *Django* for Mobile application and Front-end web applications (this project is under development and will be published soon).

Experience
----------
As I mentioned before, currently, I am working for IT company as an intern purposed on *Python* developments and *Data Analysis*. I have had my interest on *HTML&CSS* while I was 15 y.o. Then my interest has fallen for C++, and now I have been revealing something new everyday, even in *Python*. I submitted only project for _landing page_ (ekooaudit.uz, currently not available, as hosting blocked for not paying). My second and currently last project - [Telegram Online Shop Bot](https://t.me/Anori_bot).

Education
---------
I am a first-year student at the INHA University in Tashkent. At the university, I take courses from *C++*. I am learning JS basics from _javascript.info_.

English
-------
I have been learning English since I am schoolboy until now. However, as I had some break time on summer, I forgot most important parts of English which led on decrease in my speaking and grammar. Despite this, I can fully understand documentations, and everything written in English. I took IELTS also, which means I have known English quite well. But anyway, sorry beforehand for grammar, lexical mistakes or what mistakes I have in this resume. 

I tried to do my best on writing this, and limited using with only [links], *headers*, *bold* and _italics_ even I know more than this and had no chance to use all of them.
